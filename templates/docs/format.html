<h2 class="centre">Catalogue Format</h2>

<p>
	In general, STIPS expects catalogues to be formatted in the <a  
	href="//irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html">IPAC table format</a>. 
	This format was chosen both because columns may be given names, data types, and unit values; and 
	because IPAC supports keyword/value metadata which allows STIPS to determine what type of 
	catalogue it has been given. STIPS uses the <a href="//docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/">astropy.table</a>
	module to handle catalogue input and output. Note that, as of astropy 1.0, table metadata is not
	necessarily preserved when writing an IPAC table, but the resulting text file may be edited, and 
	keyword/value pairs may be added to it, after the table itself has been written.
</p>
<p>
	STIPS currently understands eight catalogue formats, named 'phoenix', 'phoenix_realtime', 'pandeia', 
	'bc95', 'internal', 'mixed', 'multifilter', and 'generic'. The required metadata and columns are 
	shown below.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-PhoenixCatalogue">Phoenix Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	A 'phoenix' catalogue is intended to include stars drawn from the <a href="//phoenix.ens-lyon.fr">phoenix simulator</a> 
	(as translated into a grid by <a href="//ssb.stsci.edu/pysynphot/docs/appendixa.html#pysynphot-appendixa-phoenix">pysynphot</a>). 
	A phoenix catalogue is a point-source catalogue which specifies each source by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID</li>
	<li>Dataset (all sources within a dataset must have the same age and metallicity)</li>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>Age (years)</li>
	<li>Metallicity ([Fe/H])</li>
	<li>Distance (kpc)</li>
	<li>Mass (solar masses)</li>
	<li>Binary status (whether or not the source is a binary companion of the previous source)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify the catalogue as a phoenix catalogue, the following metadata must be present:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=phoenix</li>
</ul>
<p>
	During the observation, this catalogue will be converted to an internal format, with any 
	necessary additional metadata added at this point. Stellar count rates will be generated from 
	the Phoenix grid (if available for the chosen instrument and filter). If the grid is not available,
	count rates will be calculated at runtime, which will make the simulation considerably slower.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-PhoenixRealtime">Phoenix Realtime Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	A real-time phoenix catalogue also includes stars drawn from the <a href="//phoenix.ens-lyon.fr">phoenix simulator</a> via pysynphot,
	but rather than specifying populations, the individual star characteristics are specified and the stars are generated at runtime. Note that,
	because this does not use the pre-computed Phoenix grid, simulations of large numbers of stars will be much slower using this method than the
	<a href="#CatalogueFormat-PhoenixCatalogue">standard Phoenix catalogue</a> format. A realtime phoenix catalogue is a point-source catalogue that
	specifies each source by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID</li>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>Teff</li>
	<li>Log(g)</li>
	<li>Metallicity ([Fe/H])</li>
	<li>Apparent Magnitude</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify the catalogue as a phoenix realtime catalogue, the following metadata must be present:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=phoenix_realtime</li>
</ul>
<p>
	During the observation, this catalogue will be converted to an internal format, with any 
	necessary additional metadata added at this point.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-Pandeia">Pandeia Phoenix Catalgue</h3>

<p>
	A Pandeia Phoenix catalogue is similar to a realtime phoenix catalogue, except that the stars are 
	generated, from the same source, via Pandeia commands and using Pandeia's keywords. A Pandeia 
	Phoenix catalogue is a point-source catalogue that specifies each source by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID</li>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>Key</li>
	<li>Apparent Magnitude</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify the catalogue as a Pandeia phoenix catalogue, the following metadata must be present:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=pandeia</li>
</ul>
<p>
	During the observation, this catalogue will be converted to an internal format, with any 
	necessary additional metadata added at this point.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-BC95Catalogue">BC95 Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	A 'bc95' catalogue is intended to include galaxies created from the <a href="//ssb.stsci.edu/pysynphot/docs/appendixa.html#pysynphot-appendixa-bc95">Bruzual and 
	Charlot Isochrone Synthesis Spectral Evolutionary Code</a> (December 1995 version). A bc95 
	catalogue is an extended-source catalogue, which specifies each source by:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID</li>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>Redshift</li>
	<li>
		Model (one of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e', with the description of each model provided in the 
		<a href="//www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/crds/cdbs_bc95.html">BC95 README file</a>)
	</li>
	<li>
		Age (one of &quot;10E5&quot;, &quot;25E5&quot;, &quot;50E5&quot;, &quot;76E5&quot;, 
		&quot;10E6&quot;, &quot;25E6&quot;, &quot;50E6&quot;, &quot;10E7&quot;, &quot;50E7&quot;, 
		&quot;10E8&quot;, &quot;50E8&quot;, &quot;10E9&quot;, years)
	</li>
	<li>Profile (one of 'expdisk' or 'devauc')</li>
	<li>Radius (arcseconds)</li>
	<li>Axial Ratio</li>
	<li>PA (degrees)</li>
	<li>Apparent Johnson V-band surface brightness</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify the catalogue as a bc95 catalogue, the following metadata must be present:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=bc95</li>
</ul>
<p>
	During the observation, the catalogue will be converted into an internal format, with any 
	necessary additional metadata added at this point. Galaxy spectra will be generated from the 
	atlas, and count rates derived through pysynphot observation of the generated spectrum.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-InternalCatalogue">Internal Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	An 'internal' catalogue is intended to include either point or extended sources, but is limited 
	to a single filter. It must contain the following columns:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID</li>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>FLUX (for point sources, count rate in the specified filter, counts/s. For sersic profiles, surface brightness inside Re in the specified filter, counts/s)</li>
	<li>TYPE (either 'point' or 'sersic')</li>
	<li>N (sersic profile index if TYPE is 'sersic', otherwise ignored)</li>
	<li>Re (half-light radius in pixels if TYPE is 'sersic', otherwise ignored)</li>
	<li>Phi (angle of PA in degrees if TYPE is 'sersic', otherwise ignored)</li>
	<li>Ratio (axial ratio if TYPE is 'sersic', otherwise ignored)</li>
	<li>
		Notes (any notes that are needed. Not used directly, but any notes <em>will</em> be retained 
		in the observed catalogue produced during the observation.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In order to identify the catalogue as an internal catalogue, and in order to use it for the 
	observation, the following metadata must be present:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=internal</li>
	<li>filter=[filter to be observed]</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This catalogue will not be converted during observation, except that the RA and DEC values 
	will be converted into X and Y values, and point sources not falling on the detector will be 
	discarded.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-MixedCatalogue">Mixed Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	A 'mixed' catalogue is identical to an internal catalogue, except that it contains one additional 
	column:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Units (one of 'p' for photons/s, 'e' for electrons/s, 'j' for Jansky, or 'c' for counts/s.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to identify the catalogue as a mixed catalogue, the following metadata must be present:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type=mixed</li>
	<li>filter=[filter to be observed]</li>
</ul>
<p>This catalogue will have its flux values converted to counts/s, and will then be treated as an internal catalogue.</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-MultifilterCatalogue">Multifilter Catalogue</h3>

<p>
	A 'multifilter' catalogue is identical to an internal catalogue, except that it does not have a filter 
	specified in its metadata and, instead of having a Flux column, it has one or more columns, each named 
	after an available filter, that indicate the source count rate in that filter. The appropriate filter's 
	count rate will be renamed as 'flux' as the catalogue is converted to internal format. The 
	'type=multifilter' metadata must be present.
</p>

<h3 id="CatalogueFormat-GenericCatalogue">Generic Catalogue</h3>

<p>A 'generic' catalogue is a point-source catalogue with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
	<li>RA (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>DEC (decimal degrees)</li>
	<li>One column for each desired filter, showing the count rate in that filter.</li>
	<li>(Optional) an ID column for each source.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	No specific metadata is required, other than that, if this catalogue has a 'type' metadata field, it 
	must not be equal to any of the above values.
